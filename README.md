# Habit Logger

Habit logger is a console application that allows users to track their habits by quantity (ex. number of glasses of water) and not time (hours of sleep)

## Requirements
- [ ] A user should be able to input a date for when the habit will occur
- [ ] All CRUD needs to target a sqlite database
- [ ] Only ADO.NET can be used, and not Entity Framework or Dapper
